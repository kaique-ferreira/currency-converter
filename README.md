This is a sample that gets data from an api and display every second the price of different currencies.

The architecture is very similar to other apps I have made, for example: https://github.com/kaique-ferreira/recipes

MVVM, with use cases , repository and Dagger wrapping up everything. There are a few Rx tricks here as well, to merge 
the result of two apis, and to control the text change events of a edit text.
